Don't write comments.

Ask me for any missing files you need. Don't just write a new one.

Tell me if I'm asking you to do something that is not easily possible.

Do not remove lines that I have commented out.

Do not remove existing comments, unless I specifically ask you to.

If you notice functionality that you think might not be being used, tell me about that, but don't delete it unless I tell you do.

Do not ever delete commented out code, unless I have specifically asked you to.
