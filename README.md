# Coriander

Build applications written in NVIDIA® CUDA™ code for OpenCL™ 1.2 devices.

## Concept

- leave applications in NVIDIA® CUDA™
- compile into OpenCL 1.2
- run on any OpenCL 1.2 GPU

## How to use

### Ensure you have the appropriate OpenCL drivers installed
For most modern AMD for example:
```
apt install pocl-opencl-icd
```


- Write an NVIDIA® CUDA™ sourcecode file, or find an existing one
- Let's use [cuda_sample.cu](https://github.com/hughperkins/Coriander/blob/76a849d9510276bc67167c9a7676d64ff04c3e4a/test/cuda_sample.cu)

# Compile to OpenCL, using `cocl`
### local:
```
$ cocl_py cuda_sample.cu
   ...
   ... (bunch of compily stuff) ...
   ...

    ./cuda_sample.cu compiled into ./cuda_sample
```
Run:
```
$ ./cuda_sample
Using Intel , OpenCL platform: Intel Gen OCL Driver
Using OpenCL device: Intel(R) HD Graphics 5500 BroadWell U-Processor GT2
hostFloats[2] 123
hostFloats[2] 222
hostFloats[2] 444
```

### docker:
Build and enter container.
```
docker compose build amd
docker compose run amd
docker compose exec amd bash
```
Move your source file to a location visable in the container
`mv cuda_sample.cu build/out`

Then inside the docker container:
```
$ source /root/coriander/activate.sh
$ cd /coriander/build
$ cocl_py cuda_sample.cu
   ...
   ... (bunch of compily stuff) ...
   ...

    ./cuda_sample.cu compiled into ./cuda_sample
```

Then back on the host (with drivers, etc installed), can run using:
```
$ cd build/out
$ ./cuda_sample
```

## What Coriander provides

- compiler for host-side code, including memory allocation, copy, streams, kernel launches
- compiler for device-side code, handling templated C++ code, converting it into bog-standard OpenCL 1.2 code
- cuBLAS API implementations for GEMM, GEMV, SCAL, SAXPY (using Cedric Nugteren's [CLBlast](https://github.com/cnugteren/CLBlast))
- cuDNN API implementations for: convolutions (using `im2col` algorithm over Cedric Nugteren's [CLBlast](https://github.com/cnugteren/CLBlast), pooling, ReLU, tanh, and sigmoid

## How Coriander works

Kernel compilation proceeds in two steps:

## Installation

Coriander development is carried out using the following platforms:
- Ubuntu 16.04, with:
  - NVIDIA K80 GPU and/or NVIDIA K520 GPU (via aws)
- Mac Book Pro 4th generation (thank you [ASAPP](http://asapp.com) :-) ), with:
  - Intel HD Graphics 530
  - Radeon Pro 450
  - Sierra OS

Other systems should work too, ideally.  You will need at a minimum at least one OpenCL-enabled GPU,
and appropriate OpenCL drivers installed, for the GPU. Both linux and Mac systems stand a reasonable chance of working ok.

For installation, please see [installation](doc/installation.md)

## Plugins

You can install the following plugins:

- [Coriander-clblast](https://github.com/hughperkins/coriander-clblast): just do `cocl_plugins.py install --repo-url https://github.com/hughperkins/coriander-clblast`
- [Coriander-dnn](https://github.com/hughperkins/coriander-dnn): just do `cocl_plugins.py install --repo-url https://github.com/hughperkins/coriander-dnn`
- Your plugin here?

[How to create a plugin](doc/plugins.md)

## Add to your own `cmake` project

- use `cocl_add_executable` and `cocl_add_library`
- see [cmake usage](doc/cmake_usage.md)

## News

- June 23:
  - factorized CLBlast implementation of NVIDIA® CUDA™ cuBLAS API, into new plugin [coriander-clblast](https://github.com/hughperkins/coriander-clblast)
- June 21:
  - created a new release [v6.0.0](https://github.com/hughperkins/coriander/releases/tag/v6.0.0), that marks a bunch of changes:
    - incorporates of course the earlier changes:
      - took some big steps towards portability and Windows compilation, ie using python 2.7 scripts, rather than bash scripts, and fixing many Windows-related compilation issues
      - the plugin architecture
      - factorizing the partial NVIDIA® CUDA™ cuDNN API implementation into a new plugin [coriander-dnn](https://github.com/hughperkins/coriander-dnn)
    - moved the default installation directory from `/usr/local` to `~/coriander`
      - this means that plugins can be installed without `sudo`
      - it also makes it relatively easy to wipe and reinstall, for more effective jenkins testing
    - `install_distro.py` is now considerably more tested than a few days ago, and handles downloading `llvm-4.0` automatically
